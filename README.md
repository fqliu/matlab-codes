Thanks for your interest in this work.
These codes are for the paper:
[1] Efficient Majorization-Minimization Based Channel Estimation for One-Bit Massive MIMO Systems, IEEE TWC
and
[2] Angular-Domain Channel Estimation for One-Bit Massive MIMO Systems: Performance Bounds and Algorithms, IEEE TVT.

The codes for the known noise variance case can be used for the conventional zero threholding, and
the codes for the unkown noise variance case can only be used for the non-zero thresholding (see [2]).
